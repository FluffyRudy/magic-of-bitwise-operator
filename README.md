# magic-of-bitwise-operator
Repository consisting of some simple but powerful bitwise operation (demo example , pratical are far complex)

## Directories
 - **bitCounter**: counts number of binary bits in given decimal number
 - **bitGenerator**: generate binary bits for given decimal number
 - <strong>*bitwiseCombination</strong>: generate combination of given bits number
 - <strong>*uniqueAmongPair</strong>: find unique number among pairs. This is interesting solution using xor which works even if number are placed in random position. since xor being commutative as well as associative it is capable of solving problem within minimum line
 - **linuxFilePermission**: This module includes `permissionGenerator.ts` which provides functions to generate Unix-like file permissions strings based on numeric inputs. It demonstrates how bitwise operations can be applied to practical problems like permission management.
